# VueJS Blog Practice Project

In this practive project I built a simple blog website using VueJS together with Vue Router and VueX as well as Tailwind CSS.

You will find more information on how to use the blog in the **How to use this blog** post on the blog itself!

**The app will only be using Vuex and no external database! As such the added data will be deleted on every refresh**

**Password:** 12345
